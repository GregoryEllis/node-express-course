// asynchronous
// With this method: We start a task and off load the task and the we start a next task right away.

const {readFile, writeFile} = require('fs')

// The moment this task is started its off loaded and we continue with our code.
console.log('start');

// With the async approach a call back function is needed. Think of it as an event-listener that does something when a button is clicked.

// This way when user #1 for example comes here and want to get this functionality node will just off load this task. And, then your application can keep on serving other users.

// An alternative approach would be to use promises and Async away
