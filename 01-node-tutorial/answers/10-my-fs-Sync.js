// If one of the users does this task or both tasks readFileSync(), writeFileSync. And they take a long time this means node will not be able to serve other users. JS in reading this code synchronously meaning it just goes line-by-line.
// If the is something that takes a long time your application is down. So no other user can do anything with that application. Because one of the users are for example reading the files and writing one.

// If file is not here node will create one. If the file is already there by default node will override all the values that are in the file.
// { flag: 'a'} creates a new value.
