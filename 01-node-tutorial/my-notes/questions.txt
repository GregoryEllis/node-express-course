I don't see the difference between calling 'npm start' to access the app vs. nodemon myApp.js. So, what's the difference when both can access the app.? 

// 1-event-loop-ex/ 1-read-file.js
const { readFile, writeFile } = require('fs')

console.log('started a first task')
// CHECK FILE PATH!!!!
readFile('../content/first.txt', 'utf8', (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
    return
  }
  console.log(result)
  console.log('completed first task')
})
console.log('starting next task')
// The sync code with be ran first. The async callback function will be offloaded meaning it will move to the back of the line. It will be completed when the sync code is finished.
// output
started a first task
starting next task
Hello this is first text file
